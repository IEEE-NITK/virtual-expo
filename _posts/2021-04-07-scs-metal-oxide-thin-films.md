## Introduction

Metal oxides have dynamic defect chemistry allowing them to possess variable electrical conductivity. Large bandgap added to defect chemistry makes it transparent along with conductivity. They have their applications in diverse fields including electronics. Various methods have been devised for oxide synthesis so far and have been utilized very frequently. Conventionally, high temperature solid state reaction is used for synthesizing metal oxides. In these methods, a mixture of the reactants is heated to a high temperature. However, the products are inhomogeneous, coarse, impure and non-stoichiometric, since no molecular mixing occurs because of the diffusion barrier.

## Combustion Synthesis

Combustion synthesis is a self-sustained, exothermic reaction between well mixed reactants to achieve rapid and economic synthesis of particulate products. Combustion synthesis (CS) is most commonly applied in the production of oxide and non-oxide materials. Combustion synthesis processes can be divided into categories based on the phases they occur:

1. Gas Phase Combustion Synthesis (GPCS): This type of synthesis not only comprises of gaseous reactants but also involves gas phase at some part of the reaction.
2. Solid Phase Combustion Synthesis (SPCS): SPCS, which comprises of solid reactants can be classified into two main types: - Self propagating High temperature Synthesis (SHS) and Volume Combustion Synthesis (VCS).
3. Liquid Phase Combustion Synthesis (LPCS): LPCS is also known as Solution Combustion    Synthesis (SCS) which primarily involves a self-sustaining reaction between a fuel and an oxidant at a set temperature. SCS has diverse applications owing to its feasibility and simplicity.

SHS and VCS have inhomogeneous mixing due to solid state, high reaction temperatures (reaching 2000K), low surface area and coarse size of products. Furthermore, additional treatment like mechanical activation, milling and dispersion are required.

## Solution Combustion Synthesis

In Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS), an oxidizer (generally metal nitrate) is added to an organic fuel (containing oxygen) known as the precursor and are mixed thoroughly, which are then ignited at a low temperature. The combustion is propagated by localized supply of energy from reaction, therefore does not require additional heat treatment steps. Molecular level mixing occurs since the reactants are in a liquid state and it has been observed that the processing temperature can be reduced by choosing a suitable precursor or refining the annealing conditions. Reduced temperature of reaction allows its easy deposition on many organic and glass substrates, increasing feasibility of reaction and reducing costs.
No external energy is required for the propagation of the reaction. The reaction is self-sustainable internally, therefore minimizing the temperature requirement. Further, combustion reaction occurs in the solution phase therefore enabling molecular level mixing and hence perfect stoichiometry. This is in turn helpful for complex and multicomponent oxides, which can be prepared by solution combustion synthesis in various morphologies.
Cheap and high throughput, efficient thin film transistors can be prepared by solution combustion synthesis which can be easily deposited on organic as well as glass substrates at low temperatures. The structural integrity of glass is not broken, since it is not heated to very high temperatures, unlike SHS or Vapor Phase Deposition. Additional steps of processing like mechanical activation, milling or dispersion are not required.

## Thin Film Synthesis

The process of synthesis involves three major steps.

1. **Preparation of precursor materials**: Organic fuel and metal nitrate are mixed together in an aqueous solution. Here, the fuel is the reducer and the nitrate is the oxidizer. The resultant oxide structure significantly depends on the type of fuel used. Preference is given to complexing fuels because of their tendency to improve mixing levels. Hydrates nitrates are preferred due to its high oxidizing powder and low decomposition temperature.
2. **Deposition of solution on substrate**: The prepared precursor is deposited on a suitable substrate. Techniques such as spray deposition, spin deposition or printing are employed for this purpose. Earliest films were deposited using spin coating technique, however later spray coating is more preferred and found to be advantageous.
3. **Annealing**: The substrate is then heated to different annealing temperatures, depending on the requirements. Different properties are observed based on the annealing temperatures and there is a general need for reducing the annealing temperature for making the process more economical. In general, combustion at temperatures as low as $$T_{anneal}$$ ~ 150oC have been observed. Annealing temperatures can further be reduced by various methods such as use of co fuels, photochemical activation etc.

## Thermal Analysis

Thermogravimetric analysis and differntial thermal analysis was performed on samples to study the difference in the formation mechanism of conventional combustion and solution combustion synthesis. From the figure, it can be observed that SCS occurs at a lower decomposition temperature as compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we can see a stabilization in the mass percentage, implying that 100% transformation has occured.

## Outlook

Solution Combustion Synthesis provides us as a major alternative to conventional sputtering and sol gel processing. There has been much development in this field however still scope of further reduction in annealing temperature is a requirement. The intense and deep knowledge of reaction chemistry as required to synthesize a given metal oxide. The processes to improve the robustness of thin films and their applications in flexible electronics and places is required. Solution combustion or solution deposition studies for thin films have increased the throughput of thin film devices to a great extent.
