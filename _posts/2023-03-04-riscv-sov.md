## Aim

This project aims to interface different Peripherals, Memory integrated with RISC-V(**R**educed **I**nstruction **S**et **C**omputer) processor and successfully implement it on FPGA.

## Introduction

SoC is an acronym for System on Chip is an IC (Integrated Circuit) which integrates all the components into a single chip and consists of a microprocessor and its subsystem customized to the desired functionality. Modern-day SoC has fundamentally evolved over the years and is now traditionally deployed in communications, data storage, and high-tech computing domains.

## About RISC-V Processor

[FemtoRV](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/README.md) is a minimalistic RISC-V design, with easy-to-read Verilog sources directly written from the RISC-V specification. The most elementary version (quark), an RV32I core, weights 400 lines of VERILOG (documented version), and 100 lines if you remove the comments. We will be using FemtoRV32 quark version for our SoC.

# Peripherals

### UART

UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)

- An interface that sends out data usually byte at a time over a single wire.
- Data transfer is **independant** of clock pulse hence asynchronous
- UARTs can operate in either Half-Duplex(two transmitters sharing a line) or Full-Duplex(two transmitters each with their own line).

#### Several Parameters that can be set by user

- Baud Rate (bits transmitted per second)
- Number of Data bits
- Parity Bit
- Stop bits

As mentioned this interface does not have a clock, the data must be sampled to recover it correctly. It needs to be sampled at least eight times faster than the rate of the data bits.
This means for an _115200_ baud UART, the data needs to be sampled **at least** at 921.6 KHz (115200 \* 8 bits).

#### UART communication

- Transmitter
- Receiver

### Transmitter ( tx )

It transmits the data serially 8 bits per second. The signals used in the transmitter.

- `i_clk` is used for the clock signal.
- Transmits the data only when the `i_wr` signal is asserted. Else transmits high signal.
- `i_data` stores the start bit ( zero ) with the data bits to be transmitted.
- `o_busy` signal indicates whether the transmitter is transmitting the data or not.
- The single bit output of the transmitter is given by `o_uart_tx` signal.

We have 4 registers

- `state` , `baud_counter` , `local_data` , `baud_stb` , for storing the state of the FSM, the clock cycles, the data bits with start and stop bits, and a flag (for indicating the readiness to transmit next bit i.e., transmits next bit if it is high) respectively.

There are 10 states in our FSM

- `BIT_ZERO` , `BIT_ONE` , `BIT_TWO` , `BIT_THREE` , `BIT_FOUR` , `BIT_SIX` , `BIT_SEVEN` are 8 states each for 8 different bits.
- `LAST` for last bit in transmition.
- `IDLE` when the transmittion isn't taking place.

#### Working

- This module takes `i_clk` , `i_data` , `i_wr` as inputs and outputs `o_busy` , `o_uart_tx` . Initially the state is made `IDLE` and `o_busy` will be low, since the transmission is not started. We have 3 always block which are triggered for each positive `i_clk` edge.
- The first block is the state machine. Initially transmission starts when the `i_wr` is high and `o_busy` is low, `o_busy` is asserted and state is assigned as `START` as soon as the transmission starts.
- When the `baud_stb` is high is when state chnages or not. If `state` is at `IDLE` then it remains at `IDLE` and `o_busy` becomes low , otherwise it leads to incrementation of state and `o_busy` becomes high.
- The `baud_counter` acts as a decremental counter that keeps track of number of cycles between each bit.
- When state changes from `BIT_SEVEN` to `LAST`, all bits have been transferred.

### Receiver ( rx )

It receives data bit by bit at the rate of 8 bits per second.

- `i_clk` is used for the clock signal.
- `i_rx_data` is bitwise input data signal included with start and stop bits.
- `o_wr` is asserted when the data in `o_data` is ready to be read.
- `o_data` is an output register to output the recived data.

We have 5 registers

- `STATE`, `baud_count`, `zero_baud`, `ck_uart`, `q_uart`. For storing fsm state, clock cycles, flag to start next state. where we use `ck_uart` to induce delay.

There are 10 states in our FSM

- `BIT_ZERO`, `BIT_ONE`, `BIT_TWO`, `BIT_THREE`,`BIT_FOUR`, `BIT_FIVE`, `BIT_SIX`, `BIT_SEVEN` are 8 states for different bits.
- `IDLE`when there's no receiving taking place, `STOP_BIT` to terminate the receiving after getting all 8 bits.

#### Working

- This module takes `clk` , `i_rx_data` as inputs and outputs `o_wr` , `o_data` . Initially the state is made `IDLE` and `o_data`,`o_wr` will be low, since the receiving is not started. We have 4 always block which are triggered for each positive `clk` edge.
- When `ck_uart` becomes low, it means start bit is detected, state changes from `IDLE` to `BIT_ZERO` and `baud_count` is initilized.
- The `baud_count` acts as a decremental counter that keeps track of number of cycles between each bit. When the `baud_count` reaches zero then `zero_baud` flag is set high which increments the state. When state changes from `BIT_SEVEN` to `STOP_BIT`, all bits have been received and the receiving process stops.

## SPI

SPI is a synchronous, full duplex main-subnode-based interface. The data from the main or the subnode is synchronized on the rising or falling clock edge. Both main and subnode can transmit data at the same time. The SPI interface can be either 3-wire or 4-wire.

## Memory

Integrating a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) with a RISC-V processor typically involves designing a memory controller that interfaces with the SDRAM and communicates with the processor through a bus interface. The memory controller manages the flow of data between the processor and the SDRAM, handling tasks such as address decoding, read and write operations, and refresh cycles.

## Wishbone

The [WISHBONE](https://wishbone-interconnect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01_introduction.html#id2) System-on-Chip (SoC) Interconnection Architecture for Portable IP Cores is a flexible design methodology for use with semiconductor IP cores. Its purpose is to foster design reuse by alleviating System-on-Chip integration problems. This is accomplished by creating a common interface between IP cores. This improves the portability and reliability of the system, and results in faster time-to-market for the end use.
