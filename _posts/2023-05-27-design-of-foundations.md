## Aim
 
To design different types of footings.
 
 
Introduction and Overview
 
## This project aims to design the isometric view of the foundation and staircase using AutoCAD and we also come to know about the different types of foundations used in different types of buildings.
 
 
## Technologies used
 
AutoCAD-2023
 
## Literature survey on footings
 
Foundation, Part of a structural system that supports and anchors the superstructure of a building and transmits its loads directly to the earth.
#Funtions of foundations
Reduction of load intensity
Even distribution of load  Provision of level surface.
Lateral stability
Safety against undermining or scouring
 
Protection against soil movements.
 
#Types of foundations
1.  Shallow foundations.
2.  Deep foundations.
#Shallow foundations
▸  	Spread footings.
  Spread the super-imposed load of the wall or column over a larger area.  Spread footings support either a column or wall.
▸  	Combined footings.
 	A spread footing that supports two or more columns is termed        as combined footing.
	 ▸ Rectangular combined footing
 	▸ Trapezoidal combined footing
 	▸ Combined column-wall footing
▸  	Strap footings.
  	A raft or mat is a combined footing that
  	covers the entire area beneath a structure
  	and supports all the walls and columns
▸  	Raft or Mat foundation.
    Footings of two columns are connected by a beam  Used where     the distance between the columns is so great that a combined trapezoidal footing becomes quite narrow.
 
# deep foundations
▸  	Deep strip, rectangular or square footings.
   A concrete strip, sometimes reinforced with steel mesh, supports the walls. The trench depth is variable but in most cases should be at least 1m with a width of 600mm.
▸  	Pile foundation.
 Loads are taken to a low level by means of vertical members which may be of timber, concrete, or steel
▸  	Pier Foundation.
   Consists of a cylindrical column of large diameter to support and transfer large super-imposed loads to the firm strata below.
▸  	Well foundation or caissons.
   A box-like structure-circular or rectangular-which is sunk from the surface of either land or water to the desired depth. 
## drawing of foundations in Autocad
	AutoCAD is a computer-aided software program created by Autodesk that enables drafters, architects, engineers, and other experienced professionals to create two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of solid surfaces and meshes.
 
Function of AutoCAD
With the help of AutoCAD here we are drawing 2D isometric view of various structures and designs and detail study about different types of foundations and its classifications
## Conclusion
  	In conclusion, AutoCAD facilitates visualizing designs in 2D, enabling architects and designers to present their ideas more effectively to clients and stakeholders. With the help of realistic drawings of foundations ,project proposals become more compelling and easier to comprehend.
