## Aim


* This project aims to investigate the nuances of the existing Quantum circuits/ algorithms. 
* Examine the topology of Quantum circuits
* Tweaking the parameters involved in the circuit and analyzing their effects on error, number of gates used, decoherence time etc to build a deeper intuition on how quantum circuits work.




## Description 
Reusability of code is a desirable characteristic of software systems. In this project we have addressed the problem of reusable code in open- source quantum computing software. We have created a python program that contains implementations of commonly used quantum computing algorithms. These algorithms are Grover’s search algorithm, Deutsch - Jozsa algorithm, and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Any quantum computing program can include this file to reuse the modules

## Implementation

## Conclusion

Designed modules to implement the following classes of algorithms: Bernstein-Vazarani (berVaz), Deutsch–Jozsa (deuJoz), Grover Search (groveSearch) and Shor's Factoring Algorithm (shor).
